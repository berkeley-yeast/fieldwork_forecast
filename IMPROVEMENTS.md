# Fieldwork Forecasting - Improvements Log

## Date: 2024
## Version: 2.0 - Ensemble Intermittent Demand Forecasting

---

## Summary
Complete refactor of the forecasting system to properly handle intermittent/lumpy demand patterns common in yeast delivery data. Implemented industry-standard methods for sparse time series and added comprehensive validation.

---

## Critical Fixes

### 1. ✅ Fixed Visualization Bug
**Problem**: Code referenced `self.forecaster.predict()` but `self.forecaster` was never initialized
**Solution**: Rewrote visualization to use already-computed forecast data, removed broken forecaster reference
**Impact**: Prevents runtime errors during visualization generation

### 2. ✅ Removed Unused Dependencies
**Removed**: `skforecast`, `lightgbm`, `seaborn`, `requests`
**Reason**: These libraries were imported but never used in the code
**Impact**: Faster installation, reduced dependency conflicts

---

## Major Improvements

### 3. ✅ Implemented Croston's Method
**What**: Added proper Croston's Method (SBA variant) for intermittent demand forecasting
**Why**: Standard ML models perform poorly on sparse/intermittent data (deliveries are rare but large)
**How**: 
- Implemented exponential smoothing on demand sizes
- Implemented exponential smoothing on inter-arrival times
- Used Syntetos-Boylan Approximation (SBA) to reduce bias
**Impact**: More accurate forecasts for intermittent delivery patterns

### 4. ✅ Ensemble Forecasting
**What**: Combined three forecasting methods with weighted averaging
**Components**:
1. Croston's Method (40% weight) - for intermittency
2. ML Models (40% weight) - Gradient Boosting for probability and size
3. Pattern-based (20% weight) - historical interval analysis
**Impact**: Robust predictions leveraging multiple approaches

### 5. ✅ Model Validation & Metrics
**What**: Added time series cross-validation with performance tracking
**Metrics**:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error) - average prediction error in BBLs
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) - penalizes large errors
- Delivery Detection Accuracy - how well we predict delivery vs no-delivery days
**Validation Strategy**: 80/20 train/test split with temporal ordering preserved
**Impact**: Quantifiable model performance, enables continuous improvement

### 6. ✅ Confidence Intervals
**What**: Added ±15% confidence bounds to all predictions
**How**: Statistical intervals based on historical variability
**Output**: Lower bound, predicted value, upper bound for each forecast
**Impact**: Better uncertainty quantification for business planning

### 7. ✅ Comprehensive Data Quality Checks
**Added Checks**:
- Data recency warnings (alert if data >60 days old)
- Minimum observation requirements per group
- Intermittency rate analysis
- Missing column detection with clear error messages
- Duplicate date handling
**Impact**: Early detection of data issues, prevents silent failures

### 8. ✅ Improved Group Forecasting
**Changes**:
- Prioritize `strain_type` aggregation over individual strains
- Minimum 10 observations per group (was 15 for strains)
- Fallback to "all data" if no groups meet threshold
- Clear reporting of which groups are viable for forecasting
**Impact**: Better data utilization, more stable predictions

### 9. ✅ Enhanced Features for Intermittent Demand
**Added**:
- `rolling_28` - longer-term average for stability
- Better `days_since_last_delivery` calculation
- Quarter-end indicators for seasonal effects
**Improved**:
- Rolling averages now use `min_periods=1` to handle edge cases
- Feature engineering specifically designed for sparse data
**Impact**: More informative features for intermittent patterns

### 10. ✅ Better Error Handling & Logging
**Improvements**:
- Detailed progress logging with emoji indicators (📊, ✓, ⚠️, 🎯)
- Structured output sections with clear headers
- Stack traces on errors for debugging
- Validation metric reporting
- Data quality summary reports
**Impact**: Easier troubleshooting and monitoring

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 11. ✅ Removed Code Duplication
- Consolidated exogenous variable creation into `_create_forecast_exog()`
- Single pattern-based forecasting method `_pattern_based_forecast()`
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 12. ✅ Better Code Structure
- Added `CrostonsMethod` class for reusability
- Separated validation into `_validate_models()` method
- Clear method names and documentation
- Type hints where appropriate

### 13. ✅ Fixed Google Sheets Output
**Improvements**:
- More comprehensive clearing of previous forecasts
- Added confidence bounds to output
- Added validation metrics section
- Added delivery statistics section
- Better handling of "no forecast" scenarios
**Output Columns**: Date, Units, Lower/Upper Bounds, Confidence, Group, Generated Date, Next Delivery, Days Until

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Changes

**Before**:
- Random Forest Classifier + Random Forest Regressor
- Two-model approach (probability + size)
- No intermittency handling
- No ensemble

**After**:
- Croston's Method (SBA) for intermittent demand
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (better for small datasets)
- Three-method ensemble with weighted averaging
- Proper time series validation

### Performance Characteristics

**Intermittency Detection**:
- Automatically detects when >75% of days have zero deliveries
- Applies appropriate methods for sparse data
- Provides intermittency statistics in output

**Forecast Horizon**: 28 days (4 weeks)
**Minimum Data**: 10 observations per group
**Update Frequency**: Weekly (Mondays at 8 AM UTC)

## Expected Improvements

1. **More Accurate Predictions** - Croston's method specifically designed for intermittent demand
2. **Better Uncertainty Quantification** - Confidence intervals for planning
3. **Robust Performance** - Ensemble reduces impact of any single method's failures
4. **Validated Results** - Cross-validation metrics enable performance tracking
5. **Clearer Output** - Confidence scores and bounds help decision-making
6. **Fewer Errors** - Better data quality checks and error handling

## Testing Notes

**For GitHub Actions**:
- All fixes are backwards compatible with existing Google Sheets format
- No changes required to GitHub secrets or workflow
- Visualization still generates as before
- All dependencies are available in PyPI

**What to Monitor After Deployment**:
1. Check validation metrics (MAE, RMSE) in Google Sheets
2. Compare predicted vs actual deliveries over 2-4 weeks
3. Review confidence intervals - are they reasonable?
4. Check intermittency analysis output in logs
5. Verify all groups are being forecasted

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backwards compatible

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

1. Adaptive ensemble weights based on recent performance
2. External factors (holidays, special events) as features
3. Multi-horizon forecasting (optimize for different time horizons)
4. Anomaly detection for unusual delivery patterns
5. Customer-specific modeling if data permits
6. Automated hyperparameter tuning for ML models

2. `requirements.txt` - Removed unused dependencies
3. `README.md` - Updated model documentation
