# Fieldwork Forecasting - Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Repository Successfully Created
âœ… **Repository URL**: https://github.com/berkeley-yeast/fieldwork_forecast

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Complete Forecasting System
- **ML-Enhanced Forecasting** with skforecast + LightGBM
- **Complex Seasonality** handling (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)
- **Exogenous Variables** (strain types, time-based features)
- **Automated Google Sheets Integration** (read from "large_account_na_data" tab "Fieldwork")
- **Prediction Output** starting at column F (index 6) as requested

### 2. GitHub Actions Automation
- **Scheduled Runs**: Every Monday at 8:00 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via GitHub Actions UI
- **Error Handling**: Logs uploaded on failure for debugging

### 3. Data Processing
- **Input Columns**: date, by_units, strain, strain_type
- **Output Columns**: Forecast Date, Predicted Units, Generated On, Next Delivery Date, Days Until Delivery
- **Forecast Horizon**: 2 weeks from current date
- **Data Validation**: Automatic handling of missing dates, invalid data

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEP - ADD GOOGLE SHEETS CREDENTIALS

You MUST add the Google Sheets credentials to GitHub Secrets:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/berkeley-yeast/fieldwork_forecast/settings/secrets/actions
2. **Click**: "New repository secret"
3. **Name**: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS`
4. **Value**: Your complete Google Cloud Platform service account JSON (the entire JSON file content)

### Example JSON format:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-account%40project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

## Testing the System

### Option 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended)
1. Go to https://github.com/berkeley-yeast/fieldwork_forecast/actions
2. Click on "Fieldwork Forecasting" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Check the logs and results in your Google Sheet

### Option 2: Wait for Monday
The system will automatically run every Monday at 8:00 AM UTC.

## Google Sheets Setup Requirements

### 1. Service Account Permissions
- Share "large_account_na_data" Google Sheet with your service account email
- Grant **Editor** access to the service account

### 2. APIs to Enable in Google Cloud Console
- Google Sheets API
- Google Drive API

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `forecast_fieldwork.py` | Main forecasting script with ML pipeline |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.github/workflows/forecast.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow |
| `README.md` | Complete documentation |
| `validate_setup.py` | Validation script for troubleshooting |
| `.gitignore` | Git ignore rules |

## Model Features

### Advanced ML Capabilities
- **LightGBM Regressor** optimized for time series
- **Lag Features**: 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days
- **Seasonal Features**: Day of week, month, quarter
- **Rolling Averages**: 7 and 14-day windows
- **Strain Encoding**: Categorical variable handling
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid search with cross-validation

### Forecasting Output
- **Next Delivery Date**: First predicted delivery within 2 weeks
- **Predicted Volume**: Units expected for delivery
- **Confidence Handling**: Only shows predictions above threshold
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of no-delivery scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Google Sheets Access Denied**
   - Check service account has Editor access to the sheet
   - Verify sheet name "large_account_na_data" and tab "Fieldwork" are correct

2. **GitHub Actions Failure**
   - Check that GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS secret is properly set
   - View detailed logs in the Actions tab

3. **No Predictions Generated**
   - Verify data quality in source sheet (valid dates, numeric units)
   - Check that there's sufficient historical data for training

### Getting Help
- Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/berkeley-yeast/fieldwork_forecast/actions
- Review the README.md for detailed setup instructions
- Failed runs will upload log artifacts for debugging
